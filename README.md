meteorserver
============

Meteor is an HTTP server which gives developers the freedom to think about web development in an entirely new way. It comprises the Meteor server and a standalone Javascript class which can be used in webpages to provide an abstraction layer for receiving data streams. Designed to be as simple and flexible as possible, Meteor offers a great solution for those wishing to add asynchronous functionality to their web projects.
